Guide for Wallet Project 

1.	This is the Homepage, This is where the Sign In and Sign Out button will be shown 
it shows your current balance Ethereum/polygon balance and also an overview of the current Ethereum/polygon value in the market 

We have used infura.io APIs to get the current values of the currencies

6.	First we will use this site 
https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/sepolia to get etherum 

as we can see we have 0.05 Ethereum in danial1’s account after we’ve used the site so now we can perform transactions

7.	We will send transactions from the “danial1” account to “testing1” 

this is the wallet ID of the “testing1” account
